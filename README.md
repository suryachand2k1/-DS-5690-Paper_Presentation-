## Overview

The paper aims to provide a structured overview of the current state of large language models (LLMs) by highlighting major unresolved challenges and identifying areas where these models have demonstrated significant success.

**Challenges identified** are grouped into three broad categories:

1. **Design Challenges**  
   Issues related to the technical construction of models, including data quality, tokenization methods, computational costs, fine-tuning requirements, inference speed, and limitations on processing long texts.

2. **Behavioral Challenges**  
   Problems encountered when using LLMs in real-world scenarios, such as sensitivity to prompt wording, generating incorrect information (hallucinations), producing biased outputs, and relying on outdated knowledge.

3. **Scientific Challenges**  
   Fundamental issues affecting the academic advancement of LLMs, such as unreliable evaluation methods, lack of rigorous experimental design, and difficulties with reproducibility of results.

**Applications areas** where LLMs have shown practical value include:

- Conversational AI (Chatbots)
- Computational Biology
- Computer Programming
- Creative Fields (e.g., writing, art)
- Knowledge-Based Tasks (e.g., information retrieval, summarization)
- Legal Domain
- Medical Domain
- Reasoning Tasks (logic and mathematics)
- Robotics and Embodied Agents
- Social Sciences and Psychology
- Synthetic Data Generation

Overall, the paper emphasizes the need to systematically address the outlined challenges to maximize the beneficial applications of LLM technology.
